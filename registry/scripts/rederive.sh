# ramp-form ones (a part carries the one- or three-factor ramp, so the other gate does not
# apply) and the tests on the quarantine list (.github/quarantine.yaml, X25), each with an
# owning issue and an expiry. A skip is a gate that did not run, so any other skip fails
# (X16), as does an expired quarantine entry.

# REDERIVE_JOBS=N (default 1) runs the tests in N pytest processes at once, on one machine. The
# tests are independent subprocess runs of the writers (each reads the data and writes only a
# scratch directory, or nothing). tools/shard splits the collected tests into N shares by their
# weights in scripts/rederive-weights.txt, so each test is in exactly one share; each process
# deselects the other shares, and the script checks that what it will run is its own share
# before it runs it. Skips and failures of every process are judged exactly as with one.
#
# The pinned commits (AISIMULATE_SHA, INFERENCEX_SHA) live in
# .github/workflows/rederive.yml, which runs this same script.
